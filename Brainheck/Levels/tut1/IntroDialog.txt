I will now explain to you the basics
You will write programs that operate on an infinite strip of cells
The eye (^ symbol) looks at a currently selected cell
It can also be called a pointer
A + command adds 1 to the value in the selected cell
A - command subtracts 1 form the value in the selected cell
For example
Program "+++++" adds 5 to the value in the selected cell
And Program "+++---" adds 3 and subtracts 3, basically it does nothing
To write a program, open a file "CurrentTask.txt" and start writing code between the curly brackets {}
But FOR THE LOVE OF SATAN, don't use the default notepad
Please download Notepad++ or whatever
Your first task is:
Write a program that adds 6 to the selected cell
