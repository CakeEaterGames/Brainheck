Sometimes you need to use the same piece of code multiple times
So instead copying and pasting create a function!
Notice that you write all of your code insite the #main{} block
You can create your own other block and use it inside your main block
Like this
#clear\n{\n   [-]\n}\n#main\n{\n   clear()+++>\n   clear()+++++>\n   clear()+>\n}
This code is then transformed into [-]+++>[-]+++++>[-]+>
And it clears cells 0 1 2 and sets their values to 3 5 1
This is not the most useful example but it will be very helpful in more complex tasks
Your task is:
Ovewrite values in cells 4 5 6 by values from cells 0 1 2
And use functions... but you don't have to
