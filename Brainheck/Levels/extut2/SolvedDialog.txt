From now on you should group all your solutions into functions that you can reuse in later tasks
It is up to you weather to do it or not though
Here's my "overenginired" solution:\n#clr\n{\n	[-]\n}\n#move\n{\n	[->>>>+<<<<]\n}\n#t\n{\n	clr()4<move()\n}\n#main\n{\n	>>>>\n	3(t()5>)\n	7<\n}
Also one thing to note, is that we automatically remove all instances of +- -+ <> >< in your code
So feel free to use it to your advantage
