Next commands are the hardest ones
Commands [ and ] handle "conditions" and "loops"
When the [ command is executed, if the value in the current cell is greater than 0 the program continues inside the pair of square brackets
and if the value in the current cell is 0 the program skips all comands inside the pair of square brackets
For example
Program "[+++>]" checks if the value in the current cell is greater then 0. If it is, than the programm adds 3 to the value in the current cell and moves the eye to the right
But the brackets also act as a loop
When the programm reaches the ] it checks if the value in the current cell is greater then 0. And if it is, the program jumps back to the [ and the code inside the brackets repeats
For example
Program "[-]" clears the current cell. (While the value is greater then 0 subtract 1)
