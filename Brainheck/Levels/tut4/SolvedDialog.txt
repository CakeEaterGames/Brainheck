And that's it
You know all of the commands
+-<>,.[]
Using these 8 you can calculate pretty much everything
And it is up to you to figure out how 
I will give you hints every once in a while
But don't expect me to tell you much
It's not going to be easy
Actually it's going to be very painful!
Good luck :)
